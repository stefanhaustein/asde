# Tantilla

Goal: Provide a reasonable way to code on a mobile phone.

Language:Â Roughly based on a Python subset (hence the name).

Notable differences:

 - Strict type system
 - Explicit variable declarations required (var / const)
 - Blocks terminated by an explict "end" statement 
 - Lots of stuff missing
